# Movement analysis tutorials

This repository collects my tutorials introducing statistical models for animal movement data. The first tutorials are the results of a workshop I co-organized the University of British Columbia in collaboration with Garrett Street and Luca Borger, BES Movement Ecology Special Interest Group, the Biodiversity Research Center, Dept. of Statistics, and the Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries.

Note that the data files are not to be used for your own research and are provided here as examples to be able to learn how to apply the models to data. Use the code as you want, but please acknowledge the me and /or link the Github if you use the teaching material (Thanks!).

For now, the tutorial available are on:
- Hidden Markov models
- State-space models

Please keep in mind that some of the packages used in the tutorials can be finicky to install. Some of them will require you to have Rtools (Windows user) or XCode (mac user). Some of them will also require that you have JAGS installed.
